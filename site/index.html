<h1>Gaston Ngailo</h1>
<P>I’m Gaston Ngailo, 
I got my start in business couple of years ago after my best mentor showed me how successful he was selling information products online. I can still remember everything that, since I hated to be an employee, just after my college life, I used to lock myself inside my bedroom, sleepless like a nightmare, struggling and trying to figure out how i can start my own business. It is until when I got an email from one of my top mentors who happen to be a successful entrepreneur in information product businesses offering one of his best online training programs. When I finally finished taking my training, which I registered, I started to see patterns in most people’s lives that happen to be their unmated needs if not unsolved problems. I felt so powerful if I could solve their problems and help them get their unmated needs met. It was just me, my HP Pavilion laptop and internet connection that took my online businesses into reality. Since then I devoted my entire life helping people get the ability of having power and influence over others, get money and wealth if they want, attract people they want in their life. Also helping them avoid certain outcomes they don’t want in their life. That is failures, worries, frustrations, rejections and insignificance

Don’t look for a job or switch jobs; start your own business 
My advice to everyone I meet is don’t switch jobs; start your own business. But first, to make sure you don’t revert back to being an employee you will have to know and understand how Power, Control, Leverage, Productivity, Money and Freedom can work against you when you are an employee. This is why the rest of this book will concentrate of me introducing you to these six concepts. What are they, why they are important, and most importantly how being an employee can make them work against you and probably sabotages your level of success in business and life in general.  It is my belief that, when you are fully aware of how these core concepts can work against you when you are an employee, and then just like me, you might change your perspective and start your own business. That is what this book is all about.
</P>
